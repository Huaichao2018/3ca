# 3ca
This repository contains code relating to the Curated Cancer Cell Atlas (3CA), including code for reproducing analyses and figures on the [3CA website](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/sites/3CA), and code for reproducing the analysis in Gavish et al. "The transcriptional hallmarks of intra-tumor heterogeneity across a thousand tumors".

### Source code for Gavish et al.
Code for reproducing the analyses in the Gavish et al. study is contained in the ITH_hallmarks directory. A few notes on this:
- Some of the external datasets used are annotated with their source (e.g. URL to paper) via comments in the code.
- The 'hgnc_complete_set.txt' file can be downloaded from the HGNC website: <https://www.genenames.org/download/archive/>.
- Other datasets used are available on request.
